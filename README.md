<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 align="center"><b>About The Project</b></h2>

LifeHack 2021 is a 24-Hour virtual hackathon that wants you to develop innovative software solutions to make a positive change in peoples’ lives in a post-COVID world. Through exciting workshops and events, you will have the chance to learn various technologies from web development to utilizing cloud services. There will be 2 themes for participants to choose from: Education and Social.

<br />

### **Inspiration**

To combat the changing circumstances of our learning ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, universities across Singapore have taken an approach of home-based learning (HBL) ahead of time to protect the well-being of its students and to ease the spread of the virus by limiting on-site activities. As a result, it is often common to see your everyday standard university student nowadays to participate in online classes and lectures in lieu of on-site lectures and attendance. However, we have noted (and from ourselves, too!) that students can find it harder to concentrate in a virtual environment for their learning and experience, and may find themselves in a difficult situation booking consultations with their professors, or even having a social event with their own friends.

From the use of qualitative analyses on our end, we have established that these problems can be sorted down mainly to educational needs, albeit to social needs as well to a smaller degree. Through our diverse expertise and approach, our team has pondered on the feasibility of making educational content easier to access and open to university students, while leveraging on the effectiveness on the growing capabilities of technology and messaging platforms to formulate a solution that can not only satisfy their educational needs, but to also foster a virtual community within the school and to go beyond than being separated at our own homes.

<br />

### **What it does**

Our solution encompasses on the core features of empowering students to a wide variety and array of resources for them to learn and understand from; building specific communities which share similar academic majors or modules to help students with one another on not only on their academic problems, but also by fostering a healthy discussion with social virtual study groups.

As our team recognizes the impact of user retention in encouraging scalability and sustainability within our solution, we have added features and enhanced our back-end infrastructure with cloud computing so as to ensure the best user experience to the students.

```

```sh
1. python -m venv venv                              # Creates virtual environment locally
2. venv\Scripts\activate                            # Activates virtual environment
3. python -m pip install -r requirements.txt        # Installs all dependencies
